# Tiles

An application based on the HTML5's canvas.

Its goal is to become a standard boilerplate code to jumpstart your canvas application. It is based on [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) (a Javascript module loader), so it has a nice modular structure. This means that every script will be defined as a module and will return something (an object, a function or just a primitive value).

Directory layout is the following:

index.html
scripts/
    app.js
    main.js
    require.js
    app/
        shape.js
        tile.js
        sprite.js
    lib/
        backbone.js    
        jquery.js
        underscore.js
    helper/
        util.js
assets/
    css/
        style.css
    images/
        tiles/
            tile1.png
            tile2.png
        sprites/
            sprite1.gif
            sprite2.gif
